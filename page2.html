      <h1>YOUR PRIVACY IS OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANT TO US...</h1>
      <p>...in that we really want you to give it up so that we can make money.</p>
      <p>Before you continue using our website, we would like you to know that we collect your data so that we can improve your experience on our site by analyzing how you use it, but mostly so that we can profit off of selling that data.</p>
      <p>And yeah, this information also includes your location and other incredibly personal information about you.  What do you have to hide?  Anyway, we're just going to sell this information to advertising companies, and of course, the U.S. government, who we all know has never done anything shady, ever, and is 100% trustworthy.</p>
      <p>Don't worry, you're allowed to say no.  We're not fascists, of course.  Just know that your experience of this website will be fundamentally different.</p>
      <p>So, what do you say?  Are you okay with us collecting all of your information?  Did you actually read this?</p>
